---

## How to Start Trading Now

### Option 1: Paper Trading (Recommended First)

```bash
cd c:\Users\USER\Desktop\Algotrading
python scripts/live_trading/start_paper_trading.py
```

This will:

- ✅ Check for existing instances (prevents conflicts)
- ✅ Validate configuration
- ✅ Start bot in paper trading mode
- ✅ Send Telegram notifications

### Option 2: Force Stop & Restart

If you get an error about an existing instance:

```bash
python scripts/live_trading/start_paper_trading.py --force-stop
```

This automatically stops any running instance before starting.

---

## Verify Everything is Working

### 1. Test Telegram Connection

```bash
python scripts/live_trading/telegram_alert_system.py --test
```

**Expected:** You should receive test messages in Telegram

### 2. Check No Instances Running

```bash
python scripts/live_trading/process_manager.py --check
```

**Expected:** `[INFO] No instance is running`

### 3. Verify Docker is Clean

```bash
docker ps -a | findstr freqtrade
```

**Expected:** No output (no containers)

---

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Single Instance Only

**Never run multiple instances with the same Telegram token!**

The process manager now prevents this automatically, but be aware:

- ✅ Only ONE bot can run at a time
- ✅ Process manager enforces this
- ✅ You'll get a clear error if you try to start a second instance

### 📝 Configuration Changes

**Telegram is now ONLY enabled in:**

- `user_data/config_live_trading_6x.json` (your main config)
- `user_data/config_live_real.json` (live trading)

**Telegram is DISABLED in:**

- All backtest configs (they don't need it)
- Analysis configs
- Dry run configs

### 🔐 Security

Your Telegram credentials are now in:

- `.env` file (NOT committed to git)
- This is the secure way to store credentials

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Another instance is running"

**Solution 1:** Stop it manually

```bash
python scripts/live_trading/process_manager.py --stop
```

**Solution 2:** Use force-stop flag

```bash
python scripts/live_trading/start_paper_trading.py --force-stop
```

### "Telegram not working"

**Check:**

1. Token is correct in `.env`
2. Chat ID is correct in `.env`
3. You've started a conversation with your bot
4. Run test: `python scripts/live_trading/telegram_alert_system.py --test`

### "Docker container not found"

This is normal! We cleaned them up. The startup script will create a new one.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test with paper trading:**

   ```bash
   python scripts/live_trading/start_paper_trading.py
   ```

2. **Monitor for 24 hours:**
   - Check Telegram notifications
   - Verify trades are being analyzed
   - Watch for any errors

3. **Review documentation:**

   - `docs/deployment_checklist.md` - Deployment procedures

4. **When ready for live trading:**
